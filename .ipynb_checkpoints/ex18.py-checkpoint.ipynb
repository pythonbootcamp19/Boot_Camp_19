    "#1. They name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers.\n",

    "#3. Using 1 and 2, they let you make your own “mini-scripts” or “tiny commands.”\n",
    "#You can create a function by using the word def in Python. I’m going to have you make four different functions that work like #your scripts, and then I’ll show you how each one is related.\n",

    "# 3. Did you put an open parenthesis right after the function name?\n",
    "# 4. Did you put your arguments after the parenthesis separated by commas?\n",
    "# 5. Did you make each argument unique (meaning no duplicated names)?\n",
    "# 6. Did you put a close parenthesis and a colon after the arguments?\n",
    "# 7. Did you indent all lines of code you want in the function four spaces? No more, no less.\n",
