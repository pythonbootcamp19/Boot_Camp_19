and # both the condition has to be true
or # one of the condition has to be true
not # not negates the logic. opposite of true. negative truth.
!= # not equal. is one more way to check the logic.
== # if you are assigning a variable you use single = . But if you are checking the equal value == 
>= #greater than or equal
<= #less than or equal
True # on or off, true or false two different state.  
Flase #
# We use The Truth Tables a lot in computer science
if it's not false it's true (because there are only two state)
not true false
